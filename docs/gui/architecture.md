# AI Chat Reader - GNOME GUI Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for the GNOME GUI front-end of the AI Chat Reader application, designed to run on Ubuntu. The front-end is built using GTK4 and libadwaita, following GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for a native GNOME experience.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Components

#### 1.1 Application Window (`MainWindow`)
- Main application window following GNOME HIG
- HeaderBar with window controls and main actions
- Responsive layout that works on different screen sizes

#### 1.2 Chat Interface
- `ChatView`: Displays the conversation history
- `MessageBubble`: Individual message bubbles with different styles for user/assistant
- `InputArea`: Text input with send button and optional attachment support

#### 1.3 Navigation
- `Sidebar`: Navigation panel for chat history and settings
- `ChatList`: Scrollable list of previous conversations
- `SearchBar`: For searching through conversation history

### 2. Data Management

#### 2.1 Data Models
- `ChatModel`: Manages the list of conversations
- `MessageModel`: Handles messages within a conversation
- `SettingsModel`: Manages application preferences

#### 2.2 Storage
- Local SQLite database for conversation history
- JSON-based configuration storage
- File-based chat export/import functionality

### 3. Integration Layer

#### 3.1 Backend Communication
- `AIClient`: Handles communication with the AI backend
- `WebSocketManager`: Manages real-time communication
- `ErrorHandler`: Centralized error handling and user notifications

#### 3.2 System Integration
- `NotificationManager`: Handles desktop notifications
- `MimeHandler`: Manages file associations and URI handling
- `Keybindings`: Configurable keyboard shortcuts

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **GTK4**: Primary UI toolkit
- **libadwaita**: For modern GNOME UI components
- **Blueprint**: For UI templating (optional)
- **GJS**: JavaScript bindings for GTK

### Data Management
- **Gio.Settings**: For application settings
- **SQLite**: Local database storage
- **JSON-GLib**: For configuration and data serialization

### Development Tools
- **Meson**: Build system
- **Flatpak**: For packaging and distribution
- **GJS Console**: For debugging

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the UI (sends a message)
2. Input is validated and processed
3. Message is added to the local database
4. Request is sent to the AI backend
5. Response is received and processed
6. UI is updated with the response
7. Conversation state is persisted

## Security Considerations

- All network communications use HTTPS/WSS
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- File operations are sandboxed
- Regular security updates for all dependencies

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading of conversation history
- Efficient message rendering with list views
- Background processing for non-UI tasks
- Memory management for large conversations

## Future Extensions

- Plugin system for additional AI providers
- Markdown support in messages
- Code syntax highlighting
- Custom themes and appearance settings
