This tool helps you convert your Claude conversation exports from JSON format into readable Markdown files.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. First, you'll need to export your conversations from Claude using the data export feature\n2. Place the JSON file in the data/raw directory\n3. Run the script provided in the repository\n4. The tool will convert all your conversations into a nicely formatted Markdown file in the data/processed directory\n\nThe converter handles all the message formatting, timestamps, and conversation organization automatically. Is there any specific aspect of the tool you'd like to know more about?",

The repository actually includes two separate scripts:\n\n1. `convert_claude_chats.py` - For converting Claude conversation exports\n2. `convert_openai_chats.py` - For converting OpenAI/ChatGPT conversation exports\n\nEach script is specifically designed to handle the unique format of exports from its respective platform. The OpenAI format is quite different from Claude's, but the converter handles both and produces consistently formatted Markdown output regardless of the source.\n\nSo you can use this tool no matter which AI assistant you prefer to chat with. The process is very similar for both - just use the appropriate script for your export format.",

No additional dependencies are required! The scripts use only standard Python libraries that come with Python 3.6 or later.\n\n3. Ensure you have the proper directory structure:\n   - data/raw/ (for your input files)\n   - data/processed/ (where output will be saved)\n\nThat's it! The converter is now ready to use.
